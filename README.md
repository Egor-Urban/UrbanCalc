## Calculator...

It's probably weird that I decided to make a calculator, since this is usually the first project people start coding with. Well, there are a few reasons for this decision: 
`1) I need to get to grips with the Slint graphics framework. `
`2) I simply haven't found a good cross-platform calculator I like, so I decided to write one specifically for myself:)`

When the project is finished, I'll add to the readme, but for now it's mostly empty.
